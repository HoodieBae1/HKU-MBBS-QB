He enjoys good past health except blurring of vision due to partial lens dislocation over his right eye. On physical examination, he is thin and 6 feet tall, his blood pressure is 90/40 mmHg over his left arm but is not measurable over his right arm. His heart rate is 120 beats per minute and the jugular venous pressure is elevated. The apex beat is not displaced and is in normal character. On auscultation, the heart sounds are normal and a grade 2/6 early diastolic murmur is heard over the left sternal border. Electrocardiogram shows diffuse low voltage with ST segment elevation over all 12 leads.

        "question": "Mrs Wong is a 55-year-old housewife who had a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as part of a well-woman check-up two weeks ago. The DEXA showed that her bone mineral density (BMD) T score was -1.5 S.D. She consults you today for further explanation and management of the DEXA findings. She had menopause eight years ago. Her past health was good and she is not taking any long-term medication. She is asymptomatic and physical examination does not show any abnormal finding. (a) How would you explain the diagnosis and the significance of the T score to Mrs Wong? (b) How are you going to manage her?",
        "official_answer": "(a) Explanation: A T-score of -1.5 indicates osteopenia, which means her bone density is lower than that of a healthy young adult, but not low enough to be classified as osteoporosis. This places her at an increased risk of fractures compared to someone with normal bone density.\n(b) Management: Use the FRAX tool to calculate her 10-year probability of major osteoporotic and hip fracture. If the risk is below the treatment threshold (e.g., <20% for major fracture, <3% for hip fracture), pharmacological treatment is not indicated. Management would focus on lifestyle modification: ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, regular weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, and limiting alcohol. Regular monitoring of BMD may be considered.",

Urinalysis: Confirm haematuria with dipstick and microscopy to assess for dysmorphic red cells (glomerular) vs. normal red cells (non-glomerular).\n2. Urine Protein: Quantify with spot urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR).\n3. Urine Culture & Cytology: Rule out infection and malignancy.\n4. Blood tests: CBC, RFT, coagulation, and serology for secondary causes (ANA, complements, ANCA, hepatitis screen).\n5. Imaging: Ultrasound of kidneys and bladder.

        "question": "Mr Au, a 70-year-old retired carpenter, is known to have hypertension for 10 years and diabetes mellitus for 5 years. He is on indapamide 2.5 mg once and gliclazide 80 mg twice daily. On a regular follow-up consultation you found that his fasting blood glucose by haemstix was 9 mmol/L, his blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg, and there was one + protein in his urine by dipstick test. (a) What problems have you found and what other problems do you anticipate? (b) What further investigations will you carry out? (c) How would you manage the patient if further investigation confirms significant proteinuria?",
        "official_answer": "(a) Problems found: Poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled diabetes, and proteinuria. Problems anticipated: Progression of diabetic nephropathy, increased cardiovascular risk (IHD, stroke), and other microvascular (retinopathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular complications.\n(b) Investigations: Quantify proteinuria (spot urine UPCR or 24h urine protein), assess renal function (RFT), check glycemic control (HbA1c), lipid profile, and screen for complications (ECG, fundoscopy).\n(c) Management: \n1. Lifestyle: Advise on diet, exercise, smoking cessation.\n2. BP control: Start an ACE inhibitor or ARB for renal protection due to proteinuria.\n3. DM control: Optimize glycemic control, possibly switching from gliclazide to an agent safer in renal impairment (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitor) to avoid hypoglycemia.\n4.

        "question": "A 44-year-old Filipino woman with good past health presented to the Accident and Emergency Department with 3 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. A few days prior to the seizures, she complained of headache, dizziness, and was noticed to have mental dullness and confusion. She had not received any treatment prior to her admission to hospital. Physical examination revealed a low-grade fever. Her GCS was 12/15 (E3V4M5). There was no neck stiffness and focal neurological signs. On admission, her blood tests showed increased neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, hyponatraemia of 110 mmol/L, and mild elevation of liver parenchymal enzymes. Oxygen saturation on oximetry was 98% on 28% oxygen. CT of the brain showed mild cerebral oedema. LP was performed. Opening pressure was 24 cm H2O (normal up to 15 cm H2O). CSF analysis showed WCC of 60/mL of CSF (normal <5) predominantly lymphocytes without any red blood cells, protein was 1.16 g/L (normal 0.6 g/L), glucose was 3.7 mmol/L (simultaneous blood glucose was 5.9 mmol/L).\n(a) What is the most likely diagnosis?\n(b) What other investigations would be helpful to support or confirm your diagnosis?\n(c) What drug treatment would you start on admission?\n(d) CSF culture was subsequently tested positive for Coxsackievirus A, type 10.
