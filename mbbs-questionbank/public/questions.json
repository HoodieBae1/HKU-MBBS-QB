At 4 hours post-ingestion, draw a serum paracetamol level and plot it on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram.\n4. If the level is above the treatment line, start an infusion of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to prevent hepatotoxicity.\n5. If presentation is late (>8 hours) or time is unknown, start NAC immediately.\n6. Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation profile. If acute liver failure develops, consider referral for liver transplant based on King's College criteria.",

        "official_answer": "(a) Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, now in a state of relative adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroid use and suppression of the HPA axis.\n(b) A short synacthen test (SST) to assess the adrenal response. An expected low plasma cortisol after administration would confirm adrenal suppression. A 3-day long synacthen test could also be used to demonstrate a progressive increase in cortisol.\n(c) Advise her to stop taking the drug (likely an exogenous steroid). She should be asked about any history of topical steroid, TCM, or over-the-counter drug use. The steroid should be withdrawn slowly, and she may need steroid cover during periods of stress (like surgery) to avoid an adrenal crisis.",

Altered Pharmacokinetics: Absorption may be delayed, distribution is altered (more body fat, less water), metabolism is reduced (lower hepatic function), and excretion is decreased (reduced GFR), leading to drug accumulation.\n3. Altered Pharmacodynamics: Increased sensitivity to certain drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) due to changes in receptor responses.\n4. Poor Compliance: Cognitive impairment, complex regimens, and physical limitations can lead to medication errors.\n5. Multiple Comorbidities: The presence of multiple diseases increases the likelihood of adverse drug-disease interactions.",

He often misplaced his belongings and was forgetful of recent events. He had word finding difficulties and he had one episode of getting lost in the street. He required assistance in his basic activities of daily living because of his cognitive problem. He could maintain his hobbies. He has no problems in sleep or appetite.\n(a) What do you think this gentleman is suffering from — mild cognitive impairment or dementia? Name one problem in this gentleman to justify your answer.\n(b) Give two most likely differential diagnoses for his cognitive problem. Briefly explain your answer.\n(c) Name two imaging studies which may be useful in the diagnosis.\n(d) Name one class of medication and give an example of such a medication which may be used in the treatment of the cognitive disorder in this gentleman.",
        "official_answer": "(a) Dementia. The cognitive decline is significant enough to interfere with basic activities of daily living (B-ADL), which is the defining feature of dementia over mild cognitive impairment.\n(b) Differential diagnoses are Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). PDD is more likely as the motor symptoms of Parkinson's preceded the dementia by many years (>1 year).\n(c) Imaging studies include a CT or MRI brain to look for structural causes and assess for atrophy (e.g., medial temporal lobe atrophy). Functional imaging like FDG-PET or Amyloid-PET can also be useful.\n(d) The class of medication is Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI), for example, rivastigmine.",

At present, she was fluctuating in her level of alertness and orientation, and unable to recognize some of her family members. She had been noted to be increasingly forgetful for the past 9 months. Her medications included oxybutynin, bisoprolol and aspirin. On examination, her pulse was regular at 110 bpm, blood pressure 90/48, oxygen saturation 97%, and temperature 38.5°C. Her chest and cardiac examination were normal. She was drowsy with confused speech and disorientation to time, place and person. She was not consistently following commands and was unable to walk due to unsteadiness, but had no other focal neurological deficit.\n(a) What are the main differential diagnoses for the acute confusion?\n(b) From the list of differential diagnoses, what investigations should be considered?\n(c) What is the first priority in her immediate management?",
        "official_answer": "(a) The main differential diagnosis is Delirium. Precipitating causes include infection/sepsis (fever, tachycardia), head injury (subdural hematoma), drugs (oxybutynin is anticholinergic), and metabolic disturbances. This is superimposed on a background of dementia.\n(b) Investigations should include a septic screen (CBC, blood culture, urinalysis, CXR), metabolic screen (electrolytes, glucose, calcium), and an urgent non-contrast CT brain to rule out intracranial hemorrhage from the fall.\n(c) The first priority is immediate management following the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).

You suspect there are conjunctival petechiae.\n(a) What differential diagnosis would you consider?\n(b) What immediate investigations would initiate, and would you start any treatment?\nLater results from examination of the cerebrospinal fluid show 800 neutrophils/µl, with a CSF glucose 1.7 mM/L (blood glucose 5.6 mM/L), and the Gram stain shows Gram negative intracellular diplococci. You learn two other students have been admitted with an identical illness.\n(c) What is now the diagnosis, and what potential complications may occur?\n(d) What further action can be taken to protect the student's roommates and to prevent further cases in the institution? Can such action fully protect against this disease?",
        "official_answer": "(a) The primary differential diagnosis is acute bacterial meningitis, with meningococcal meningitis being most likely given the presence of petechiae. Other causes include pneumococcal meningitis and viral meningoencephalitis.\n(b) Immediate investigations include blood cultures, CBC, clotting profile, and electrolytes. Treatment should be started immediately with empirical IV antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone) at a meningitic dose, even before lumbar puncture if there is a delay. A CT brain should be performed before LP if there are signs of raised ICP.\n(c) The diagnosis is meningococcal meningitis (caused by Neisseria meningitidis). Potential complications include septic shock, DIC, adrenal hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome), cerebral infarction, hydrocephalus, seizures, and long-term neurological impairment.\n(d) Action includes contact tracing of close contacts (e.g., roommates) and providing them with chemoprophylaxis (e.g., rifampicin or ciprofloxacin). Vaccination should also be considered. This action significantly reduces but does not completely eliminate the risk of secondary cases.",

She did not have any problem with her speech, swallowing, breathing sensations or urinary and bowel functions. She has a past history of peptic ulcer, thyroid disease and vitiligo. Her family history is positive for pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and ischaemic heart disease. Three days before admission, she started to have fever, cough and sputum. These symptoms were improved after taking the medications from a general practitioner. On the day of admission, her diplopia and drooping of eyelids became much worse. In addition, she had generalized weakness with dysarthria, dysphagia and breathlessness.\n(a) What are the differential diagnoses for diplopia plus dropping of the eyelid?\n(b) What is the most likely diagnosis for her diplopia plus drooping of the eyelid?\n(c) What tests are useful in confirming the most likely diagnosis of question (b)?\n(d) What are the related diseases/problems in her past health and family history?\n(e) What should be the working neurological diagnosis during her admission?\n(f) Please outline the management principles for the neurological diagnosis of question (e).",

        "question": "A 54-year-old man, who had no significant past medical history, complained of developing progressive weakness affecting both his hands over 3 months. He also complained of choking especially when he tried to drink fluids. His family noted that his speech was increasingly slurred. There were no sensory symptoms or sphincter dysfunction. On examination, he was noted to have dysarthria, and wasting and fasciculation of his tongue. He also had weakness and wasting of the muscles of his upper limbs, including the intrinsic muscles of his hands. His upper and lower limb reflexes were brisk. The muscle bulk and power in his lower limbs appeared spared and the plantar responses were downgoing bilaterally.\n(a) What is the most likely diagnosis?\n(b) What investigations would be helpful to support your clinical suspicion (and exclude other differential diagnoses)?\n(c) What is the commonest complication of this illness (causing eventual death)?",
        "official_answer": "(a) The most likely diagnosis is Motor Neuron Disease (MND), specifically Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), given the combination of upper motor neuron (brisk reflexes) and lower motor neuron (wasting, fasciculations) signs.\n(b) Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCV) are crucial to demonstrate widespread denervation and exclude neuropathy. An MRI of the brain and cervical spine is needed to rule out structural mimics like cervical myelopathy or foramen magnum lesions. Blood tests (e.g., CBC, B12, autoimmune markers) help exclude other treatable disorders.\n(c) The commonest complication and eventual cause of death is respiratory failure due to progressive weakness of the respiratory muscles.",

Examination revealed low grade fever, disorientation, mild right sided weakness, moderate aphasia and dysarthria. Complete blood counts, liver function tests and renal function tests were normal. Urgent plain CT brain revealed hypodense signal with mild mass effect over the left frontal and temporal lobes. Lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 25 cm of water, a total cell count of 60 per microlitre, a differential count of 90% lymphocytes, a protein level of 3.5 g per litre, and a glucose level of 4 mmol per litre. The simultaneous blood glucose was 6 mmol per litre.\n(a) What is the most likely diagnosis?\n(b) What is the most likely aetiology?\n(c) What investigations can confirm the underlying aetiology?\n(d) What additional investigations are useful in the diagnosis and management?\n(e) What specific treatment(s) should be considered?",
        "official_answer": "(a) The most likely diagnosis is viral encephalitis, specifically Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE).\n(b) The most likely aetiology is Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1).\n(c) The gold standard for confirmation is Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for HSV DNA.\n(d) An Electroencephalogram (EEG) is useful, often showing periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) over the affected temporal lobe. An MRI of the brain is more sensitive than CT and typically shows T2 hyperintensity in the temporal lobes.\n(e) Immediate treatment with intravenous (IV) acyclovir should be started empirically as soon as HSE is suspected, as early treatment significantly improves outcomes.",

        "official_answer": "(a) 1. Tension-Type Headache (TTH): Diffuse, band-like, non-pulsating pain; mild to moderate intensity; often related to stress. 2. Migraine: Unilateral, pulsating, moderate to severe pain; associated with nausea/vomiting or photophobia/phonophobia; may have an aura. 3. Headache from Intracranial Space-Occupying Lesion (SOL): Progressively worsening headache; worse in the morning or with Valsalva; associated with focal neurological deficits or papilloedema.\n(b) A full neurological examination, including fundoscopy, cranial nerves, power, reflexes, and coordination, is essential to look for any focal deficits suggesting a secondary cause. Blood pressure should be checked. Fundoscopy is critical to screen for papilloedema, a sign of raised intracranial pressure.\n(c) Management would focus on reassurance that there is no serious underlying cause. Lifestyle advice including stress management, regular exercise, and adequate sleep should be provided. Simple analgesics (e.g., paracetamol, NSAIDs) can be used for acute episodes.

What are your immediate actions?\n(e) The shaking continues for several minutes — what would be an appropriate treatment for the patient at this stage?",
        "official_answer": "(a) The two most likely underlying causes are a generalized seizure (epilepsy) or syncope (e.g., cardiogenic or vasovagal) with convulsive movements.\n(b) Blood tests should include a fingerstick glucose, electrolytes (including calcium, magnesium), CBC, renal and liver function tests. A creatine kinase (CK) level is often elevated after a true generalized tonic-clonic seizure.\n(c) An urgent non-contrast CT of the brain to rule out acute intracranial pathology and an Electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for epileptiform activity are important investigations.\n(d) Immediate actions are to ensure patient safety (remove dangers, protect head), assess Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABC), place the patient in the recovery position once shaking stops, administer oxygen, and establish IV access.\n(e) If the seizure continues for more than 5 minutes, it is status epilepticus.

        "question": "An otherwise healthy 25-year-old secretary consulted you for episodic unilateral throbbing headaches. She started to experience on and off headaches when she was 15 years old. The headaches were infrequent and less severe in the past, and relief was obtained by the use of simple analgesics. Following a recent chance in her job, her headaches have become more frequent, longer-lasting, more severe, and non-responsive to simple analgesics. Her general physical and neurological examinations are normal.\n(a) What is the diagnosis of her headaches?\n(b) Does she need a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of her brain?\n(c) What treatment can be offered to abort the headache?\n(d) What treatment can be offered to reduce the frequency and severity of the headache?",
        "official_answer": "(a) Migraine (without aura).\n(b) No. The history is classical for migraine and the neurological exam is normal, so neuroimaging is not typically required.\n(c) Abortive treatment: Simple analgesics (paracetamol, NSAIDs), antiemetics (metoclopramide), and specific migraine medication like triptans (e.g., sumatriptan).\n(d) Prophylactic treatment: Lifestyle modifications (avoid triggers), and pharmacological options such as beta-blockers (propranolol), calcium channel blockers (verapamil), antidepressants (amitriptyline), or anti-epileptics (topiramate, valproate).",

Prior to admission, he had 3 tonic-clonic seizures within 40 minutes, each lasting 60 to 90 seconds. He had a strong smell of alcohol. On examination, the patient remained drowsy in between the episodes of seizures. His airway was clear and he was breathing spontaneously, with a sinus rhythm of 120/minute, and BP 130/69 mmHg. He had no signs of physical trauma. He has no history of epilepsy or diabetes mellitus. What immediate measures would you carry out to help this patient?",
        "official_answer": "Immediate measures for this patient with status epilepticus (due to incomplete recovery between seizures) include:\n1. ABCs: Ensure airway patency (recovery position), provide supplemental O2, and establish IV access.\n2. Glucose Management: Check rapid blood glucose (H'stix). Administer IV 100mg thiamine followed by D50 if hypoglycemic (<4 mmol/L).\n3. Seizure Termination: Administer IV benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide) as first-line treatment.\n4. Investigations: Draw blood for CBC, L/RFT, electrolytes (Ca, PO4), ammonia, ABG, toxicology screen, and serum alcohol level.\n5. Second-line Treatment: If seizures persist, administer second-line anticonvulsants such as IV phenytoin (Dilantin), valproate (Epilim), or levetiracetam (Keppra).",

        "official_answer": "(a) The lung function tests show a severe obstructive pattern (FEV1/FVC = 40%) with hyperinflation (high RV, TLC). The ABG shows acute-on-chronic type II respiratory failure (low pH, very high PaCO2, high HCO3-). High haemoglobin indicates secondary polycythemia. The clinical presentation of oedema and headache with these findings suggests COPD complicated by acute-on-chronic respiratory failure and cor pulmonale.\n(b) First three hours management: 1. Controlled oxygen therapy (aim SpO2 88-92%). 2. Nebulized bronchodilators (beta-2 agonist and anticholinergic). 3. Systemic corticosteroids (IV or oral). 4. Consider non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for respiratory acidosis. 5. Treat cor pulmonale with diuretics and fluid restriction. 6. Obtain a CXR to rule out triggers like pneumonia.",

Lung function shows a restrictive pattern with reduced diffusion capacity. The ABG shows acute-on-chronic type II respiratory failure. There is secondary polycythemia and clinical evidence of cor pulmonale.\n(b) On chest radiograph, one would look for signs of asbestosis such as pleural plaques (especially diaphragmatic), lower zone reticulonodular opacities, and honeycombing.

He had no recent travel for the past few months. He attended A&E Department with temperature 39°C, blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, pulse rate 120/min regular, and bronchial breath sounds with coarse crackles in the right lower chest posteriorly. Initial blood tests revealed WBC 25 × 109/L (75% neutrophils), urea 10.5 mmol/L (N: 3–8.8), and creatinine 97 umol/L (N: 67–109). Sputum Gram stain showed Gram-negative bacilli. Chest x-ray showed right lower zone consolidation.\n(a) What is the most likely causative microbial agent for his medical illness?\n(b) Name two appropriate choices of empirical antimicrobial drug.\nOn the third day after hospital admission and empirical antibiotic treatment, he complained of right pleuritic chest pain and persistent fever. Physical examination showed decreased breath sound and stony dullness in the right lower chest. Chest x-ray showed a moderate right pleural effusion.\n(c) What is the most appropriate diagnostic procedure to be performed?\n(d) Explain how four investigation results of the above procedure can help in making your diagnosis in this case.\n(e) What additional therapeutic procedure may need to be performed after the above diagnostic workup?",

Differentiation is based on clinical features: a simple febrile convulsion involves a brief (<15 min) generalized seizure in a neurologically normal child, who recovers quickly, whereas CNS infection may have meningeal signs, prolonged drowsiness, or focal deficits.\n(b) Diagnosis & Management: The vesicles suggest varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox) as the trigger for the febrile convulsion. Management is supportive with antipyretics and hydration. Antivirals are considered if the infection is severe or the child is immunocompromised.\n(c) Future Convulsion Management: Place the child in a recovery position on their side.

The disease screened should be an important health problem in a population.\n   - incidence of cervical cancer: the 5th commonest cancer in women (2006)\n   - mortality: the 9th leading cause of death in women\n   - 459 new case / year (2006); 133 death (2006)\n2. The natural history of the disease screened should be reasonably understood.\n   - graded pre-malignant phase (cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, II & III) is recognized\n   - Long period of progression from precursor lesions to invasive cancer\n   - CIN I – majority will regress spontaneously over 2 years and about 15% will progress to CIN II or III\n   - high grade CIN – 12% of CIN III will progress to invasive disease in 10 years\n3. The screening test should be validated accurate, simple to perform, safe and available.\n   - Cervical cytology findings correlate with the presence of underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer.\n   - Cervical cytology has high sensitivity (>80%) and excellent specificity (>99%) for detecting cervical cancer.\n   - The critical step of transitional zone cell sampling and sample preservation is relatively easy to achieve and the procedure is without significant physical harm.\n   - The test is accessible in doctors' clinic, Women's Health Centre, Well Women Clinics and Family Planning Association.\n4. There should be availability of diagnostic test and accepted early treatment for the disease.\n   - diagnostic tests available for finding of atypical cells from cytology: colposcopy, cone biopsy, endometrial aspiration\n   - therapeutic procedures available for finding of pre-invasive cervical lesion: ablative or excision therapy can prevent progression of lesion to invasive disease.\n   - the treatments carry a significantly lower morbidity or side-effect than treatment for invasive cervical cancer.\n5. The screening program should be cost-effective in reducing the social burden of the disease.\n   - The effectiveness of cervical cancer screening is enhanced by: organizing screening by a central registry, screening targeted population, and screening at 3-yearly intervals.",
